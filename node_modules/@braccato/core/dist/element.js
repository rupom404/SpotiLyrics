// Light DOM, deliberately, rather than the shadow root the component this replaces used. Themes
// select on the class names in `constants.ts` at document level, `@property` registrations do not
// apply to a stylesheet inside a shadow root, and the extension and a third party should be running
// the same code. The theme handed to `theme` is adopted into the element's own document by
// `setTheme`; the module's stylesheets are the consumer's to load, the way any package's CSS is.

// the requested one by the time it fires, and `seeked` corrects it to where the media element
// actually landed, which is not always the same number. `ratechange` retakes the reading with the
// rate it will be carried at.
//
// The rest are deliberately not listened to, because the frame loop covers them by asking the media
// element whether its clock is still going rather than trusting that something said so. `ended` is
// covered by the `pause` a non-looping media element fires first and by that same question.
// `emptied` says the resource went away rather than that the clock moved, and leaves the media
// element paused at zero for the next frame to report; the README describes the one gap, which is
// `emptied` while already paused. `error` is the one that would otherwise spin, and `isClockRunning`
// below is what stops it. `waiting` and `stalled` are what the carry cap is for: both say the clock
// stopped advancing without stopping. `loadedmetadata` carries nothing this element reads, and
